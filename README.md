A fully offline cross-platform Kanban Board desktop, with a focus on simplicity and user experience. Successor to Kanban Electron, rewritten using Tauri and Nuxt.js v3 with TypeScript.

âš  **Please note: This is a very early version, it is advised to make regular JSON exports and not save any important data in this software yet.**

## ðŸ“‹ Roadmap (planned features)

- [ ] UI improvements like a bar for quick actions in the board view
- [ ] Cloud sync capabilities using a custom backend or Supabase
- [ ] More card properties like a due date or sub-tasks
- [ ] Add tests to prevent any critical bugs
- [ ] Add custom scrollbars for all pages
- [ ] Custom backgrounds in board view
- [ ] Showcase website

Open for any contributions or feature requests, though always keep in mind that I am still a student with limited time and I might not be able to process every request immediately.
