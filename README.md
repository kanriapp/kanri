## ✨ Why Kanri?
- 🏙 Modern - featuring a clean design & new technologies like Tauri
- 👓 Familiar - uses a Kanban board layout (with unlimited boards, columns and tasks, including rich-text descriptions, sub-tasks, due-dates and tags)
- 🧾 Offline - saves your data in a local `.json` file
- 🛠 Customizable - allows for custom themes, background images and card colors
- ⌨ With power users in mind - implements keyboard shortcuts to speed up board navigation

## 📋 Roadmap
Long term vision for the project:
- 👷‍♂️ Improve current features and refactor to avoid tech debt
- ➕ Add additional small/mid-sized features with high impact (reminders, sub-tasks, etc.)
- 🚚 Work towards 1.0 release with features from the backlog like internationalization or a widget panel
- 🔍 After 1.0: Assess what direction to take (focus on offline-only features or add support for cloud sync and collaboration)

A granular list of priorities can be found [in the roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/kanriapp/projects/2).

This project is open for any contributions or feature requests as long as they are polite, provide enough context and remain patient (replies might take a few days).

## 🛠 Contributing & Build Setup
If you want to contribute, please take a look at the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/trobonox/kanri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
The `main` branch is equivalent to a `dev` branch where development is done on - submit PRs here. The `release` branch is similar to a `stable` branch with the code of latest release.

**Build Setup**:
If you want to build the app, you need to install Node.js (latest LTS version recommended), a package manager like yarn and the [&nearr;&nbsp;Tauri development environment](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).
Then, depending on your use case you can run the commands below:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start debug tauri build
yarn tauri dev

# Build tauri for production
yarn generate
yarn tauri build
```
